# FLATDANGO WEB APP

Flatdango is a simple web application that offers a platform for purchase of movie tickets.

## BUILT WITH
This application was built with the following technologies:

<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>

### GETTING STARTED
If you need to clone this repo then these are the steps to take:

Open a terminal / command line interface on your computer and navigate to your desired directory.

Clone the repo by using the following:

  git clone https://github.com/LincKim/Flatdango-Web-App.git 
  
  or using the SSh Key:

  git clone git@github.com:LincKim/Flatdango-Web-App.git


### PREREQUISITES
The app will be live and the link is provided further down the short read.

Otherwise if you need it at you local machine then follow the following steps: 

Install the JSON Server if you dont have it yet using the following commands through your terminal:

        npm install -g json-server
This will act as our local server where we will retrieve our data from.

Start the server using the following command:

        json-server --watch db.json
Once started, the dbjson file that is found in this repository will be rendered in your browser. The link will be provided right there from your terminal. It will look something like this:

        http://localhost:3000/films 
This is the link that you will have to follow to see the data rendered from the browser.

Installing
Change directory to the repo folder:

        cd Flatdango-Web-App
(Optional) Open it in Visual Studio Code

        code .
(Alternate Option) Open it in any editor of your choice.

You are one step closer to achieving your goal.

#### Running the tests
The Web App will be live and this means that you should be able to buy(not really) a ticket for the movie you are interested in after looking at the movie list.

The Code Challenge tests my understanding on:

<li>Manipulating the DOM</li>
<li>Recognizing JS Events</li>
<li>Communicating with the server</li>
